		<p><em>“Every once in a while we are presented with a revolutionary idea
        that requires attention, and pushes the boundaries of what is possible
        in our field. We might very well have found this now, by way of Alexey
        G.”</em></p>
        <p>Wesley Ferreira – Clarinet Magazine<p>
        <p>Alexey Gorokholinsky is an accomplished clarinet virtuoso, audio
        engineer and electronic music producer.  Graduate of the Juilliard
        School and fellow of Carnegie Hall’s ensemble “CONNECT”, Alexey stays
        relentless in pushing the boundaries of his instrument as well as the
        new music for electronics and live instruments.</p>
        <p><strong>Education and Awards</strong></p>
        <p>A native of Russia, Mr. Gorokholinsky began his musical studies at age 5
        on the piano.  At age 7, he took up the clarinet, studying with his
        father, Valery Gorokholinsky, an accomplished orchestral and solo
        clarinetist. At age 15, he came to United States to attend the
        Idyllwild Arts Academy (CA) and then The Juilliard School, where he was
        a full scholarship student.  During his freshman year at Juilliard,
        he made his New York City debut at Alice Tully Hall, performing the
        Nielsen Clarinet Concerto with the Juilliard Orchestra.
        He was also a top prize winner of the Eastern Connecticut Symphony
        Orchestra, Jefferson Symphony, first annual Buffet Crampon, International
        Clarinet Association and Spotlight Awards competitions.</p>
        <p><strong>Classical Record Releases</strong></p>
        <p>During his college years, Alexey has recorded most of clarinet-piano
        repertoire including some of his own arrangements of virtuosic violin
        pieces. His 2009 CD “Delicacies” became very popular due to such virtuosic
        arrangements. The CD features works of such composers as Bazzini, Paganini,
        Tchaikovsky, Francaix, Rachmaninoff, and others. Two previous discs,
        released while he was still in school, covered masterpieces of the clarinet
        repertoire by Brahms, Schumann, Chausson, Saint-Saens, Debussy, Milhaud,
        Muczynski, Ravel, Stravinsky, and others.  He was accompanied on all three
        CDs by his mother, Marina Gorokholinsky, a student of legendary pianist
        Victor Merzhanov.His most recent CD “Grand Duo” was the first CD that was
        recorded in United States and fully engineered by Alexey himself. It features
        works by Weber and Mendelssohn and was recorded with pianist Vassily Primakov,
        owner of the label “LP Classics”.</p>
        <p><strong>Electronic Clarinetist</strong></p>
        <p>Currently, Alexey is often busy writing and performing new creative and
        dance-like electronic music with clarinet under both his real name and
        his alias “Kronodigger”. His works combine forms of modern day genres of
        electronic music, such as UK Dubstep, Techno, Drum &amp; Bass, Ambient and
        IDM with challenging classical parts for live instruments. As a child of
        the end of 20th century, Alexey takes his influences from music that had
        a breakthrough in the past 30 years of the 20th century, as well as everything
        new that seems to amuse the audiences of today. Listening to broadcasts of
        Russian pirate radio station dedicated to electronic music back in early
        90s introduced him to artists that were pioneering the electronic music
        scene from its start (Vangelis, Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk, Brian Eno) as
        well as artists that were pushing the new boundaries at the end of the
        century (Aphex Twin, The Orb, The Prodigy, Squarepusher, Amon Tobin).
        Meanwhile, being involved with many New York and world-wide based DJs lets
        him stay up to date with the most current “hot” trends and techniques of
        the electronic music world of today.Alexey Gorokholinsky releases his music
        under both his name and his alias “Kronodigger”. The latter has seen 2012
        release of three remixes on music from video game series “Legend of Zelda”,
        2015 release of EP “Subliminal Design”, 2016 release ENC015 on label
        Encrypted Audio, and a new upcoming collaboration self-titled release "TROP”
        on label Encrypted Audio as well.</p>
